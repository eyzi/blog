How many blogsites will I make before I'm satisfied?

## Answer

All of them

## Just tweet bro

It's a bit difficult to use social media platforms as a blogging site,
at least for me. For one, I will have to conform to the content rules
of the websites. Not that I seek to break them, but it does limit what
I can talk about. I like the idea of having my own place for my own thoughts.

I do use a certain microblogging site for short posts. I won't say which
one it is, but it's a relatively small and old one. My friends and I
used to use it a lot before we all migrated to Facebook and Twitter,
but it has become sort of a sanctuary where I _publicly_ vent without
the fear of being judged.

## What's here

My posts will usually be random things. This blog will just be a place
where I can organize my thoughts about dumb things that I will never
get answers to. I like to think about things, even the obvious ones we
all take for granted. I always try to understand the other side of the
argument even when I already have a firm opinion on something.

likely contain a lot of hot takes and terrible opinions

## How is this made

Please check out the
[official vitepress blog repository](https://github.com/vuejs/blog)!

It lets me create posts using markdown files. It's great. VueJS is great.
