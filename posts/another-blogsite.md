How many blogsites will I make before I'm satisfied?

---

## Answer

I will never be satisfied

## But why?

For the longest time, I have been thinking of creating a new personal blog with either Vuepress or ViteJS.
Guess what? I can make one with _both_ of them. I don't even have to choose so that's cool.

I end up just copying the content from the original repository instead of forking it because I didn't want
to work on a new repository for this, but this is fully based on [the original vitepress blog repository](https://github.com/vuejs/blog).
Do check it out.

## Topics

Random thoughts, mostly. This will just be a place where I can organize my thoughts about dumb things that
I will never get answers to.

This will most likely contain hot takes and terrible opinions. Good thing it's self-hosted. Fight me.
