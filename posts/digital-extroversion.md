Loneliness is something I can only bear physically

### Textbook Introvert

I was always *the* shy kid. I didn't have problems making friends, and
I did have friends growing up, but they were never the close kind of
friends. They were mostly people, mostly classmates, whom I am
comfortable enough to approach, as I would be too afraid to come up to
a complete stranger. Even then, I would often prefer being by myself.

I didn't have people I considered best friends until high school. The
people I actually, and predictively, would be around with all the time.
People who I'm so close to that I can say they knew more about me than
I do myself. People I didn't mind being within my "alone" space.

Those kinds of people are few and far between in my life. Currently, I
only even meet them once a year at the most frequent. Still, when I do
meet with them, it's as if we last saw each other only a day ago. I'd
say I much prefer this kind of deep, and somewhat scarce, friendship.
In front of the screen, however, I am the total opposite.

### Lesson In Games

As with others of my generation, I grew up playing games... a lot. I
had access to just as many games as the next kid, but somehow, I am not
much of a *gamer* as the people I know. In retrospect, I know exactly
the point where and when my interests diverged from most people. I can
still vividly *feel* that moment.

I was in our attic in front of my PlayStation (1). Gamepad in my hand,
struggling to get Spyro to land on a small ground at the edge of the
map. This stunt, I had to do countless times and I kept going back
just because of how fun the game is, and how badly I wanted to beat the
level. Too often, though, I would start feeling of mixed dread and
restlessness. At the time, I probably thought this was just
frustration, and it would eventually lead to me shutting off my console
and leaving the stage for another time.

It wasn't until I was introduced to my first MMORPG that I knew exactly
what I was feeling back then. It was loneliness and maybe also boredom.
The feeling that my actions would not matter one way or another as it
only really affects myself at the end of the day. MMORPGs are the games
I properly got addicted to. Now, I can't even stand the idea of playing
a single-player game. Just thinking about it bores me to death.

### The Final Form

While I've overcome most of my shyness as I grew older, I still much
prefer being alone. At least physically. Online, however, I constantly
seek anything I can share with other people. Whether it's playing games
where I'm grouped with strangers, joining forums and boards where I can
participate in discussions, or simply finding livestreams that I know
I'm watching with dozens of other people at the same time.

Opposite to my preferences in real life, I can't stand being alone
when I'm in front of my screen. I feel better when I am interacting
with other people online, and I feel bored to death when I'm not. This
discrepancy between my real and virtual social need, I can only best
describe as digital extroversion.

Could it be the anonymity? The abstraction of reality I get online?
Could I be just as enthusiastic about being around other people if the
real life dynamic is similar to that on the internet? I would lean more
towards no, but who knows? All I know is that this is just the way I am
and probably always will be. I'm certain that many others find
themselves in the same situation as I am and it would be interesting
to know why that happens exactly.

But I wouldn't sweat about chasing after the answer. I quite enjoy not
knowing, weirdly enough. That way, I can dismiss it as yet another
wonder of technology.
